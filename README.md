**MercuryTrade** is an overlay application for Path of Exile written in Java. It's designed to facilitate all possible trading interactions in the game providing a much better user experience for the players. The program went through countless design interactions and made by active Path of Exile players who use this tool themselves on a regular basis.

## FUNCTIONALITY:
---

&nbsp; *Main feature:* **Notification**

 <p align="center">
  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/hYSC6NP.png"/>
</p>
When you receive a trade related message this notification panel pops up. It contains all the information you might need to make a decision. It offers a set of fully customizable "quick response buttons" (such as "Sold" / "No" / "Wait 3m" etc, customizable) as well as buttons to invite, kick and tradewith the person who made an offer. If you've received multiple notifications before dismissing your current one, they will stack up like a deck of cards underneath each other and won't clutter the screen. Notification panels can be set up to fade out after X seconds (customizable option).


&nbsp; *Main feature:* **History**

 <p align="center">
  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/oXh2Prp.png"/>
</p>
Each notification you receive is stored in a separate file by **MercuryTrade**. History allows you to access that file in a useful way to interact with the customers. Comes in handy if you've been afking for a while or you want to reach a person you traded with some time ago or in case your client has crashed - in-game chat will be cleared, your history will not.

&nbsp; *Minor feature:* **Chat Scanner**

 <p align="center">
  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/sqmrD9a.png"/>
</p>
 
 **MercuryTrade** features a real-time **Chat Scanner**. All chat messages with matching words will be displayed in a separate window - no need to strain your eyes looking for a Trial anymore!
 
&nbsp; *Minor feature:* **SuperTrade mode**

 <p align="center">
  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/fvGWxkh.png"/>
</p>

By default (on the left) each consecutive notification you receive is folded to save screen space. SuperTrade mode is a switch that will force notification panels to be fully displayed. This is useful if you need to manage a lot of trades with multiple people at once, i.e. exchanging currency or other commodities, because people come and go in no specific order. This will clutter the screen with notifications, but all of them will be right in front of your eyes.

&nbsp; *Minor feature:* **Accessibility status**

</p>

**MercuryTrade** notifications have an **indication for when a person comes in or leaves your hideout** - that way you can offer a trade as soon as possible and keep track of all the people without even closing your stash. Especially useful for SuperTrade mode.


Important to mention: in Path of Exile when you use your stash you can't click on party frames, because they're hidden behind the stash window. **MercuryTrade** solves this inconvenience as you can interact with the person through a related notification panel.

&nbsp; *Minor feature:* **Do not Disturb**

Activate this mode if you don't want to see (and hear!) anything from the application for a while. **MercuryTrade** will continue working in hidden mode.

## HOW TO INSTALL:
---

Download and install Java on your computer, then open MercuryTrade.jar. Because the program operates on top of a Path of Exile window as an overlay, **make sure your client is not in fullscreen mode**.

Upon launch you'll be greeted with a short overview of the application (same as this ReadMe) or patch notes. Afterwards you should see these 2 new panels: **Task Panel** and **Notification Panel (template)**

<br/>

**Task panel**:

* (1) **Do Not Disturb** mode button switch.

* (2) **SuperTrade** mode button switch.

* (3) **Chat Scanner** panel window.

* (4) **History** panel window.

* (5) **Panel reposition** mode.

* (6) **Settings**.
  
* (7) **Exit**.

<br/>

**Notification panel (template)**

* This dummy notification is shown for when you 1st time run the program. This will allow you to reposition the panel to your taste and to just see how it will look like before you receive a legit trade related message.
