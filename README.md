**MercuryTrader** is a Path of Exile overlay platform written in Java. It's designed to facilitate all the possible trading interactions within the game providing a much better user experience for the players. The program went through countless design interactions and made by active Path of Exile players who use this tool themselves on a regular basis.

## FUNCTIONALITY:
---

&nbsp; *Notification*

When you receive a trade related message this notification-like panel pops up. It contains all the information you need to make decisions. It offers fully customizable "quick response buttons" (such as "Sold" / "No" / "Wait 3m" etc) as well as buttons to invite, kick and tradewith the person. In case you've recieved multiple notifications before dismissing your current one, they will stack up like a deck of cards underneath each other and won't clutter the screen.


&nbsp; *History*

Each notification you receive gets stored in a separate file by MercuryTrader. History allows you to access that file in a useful way to interact with customers. Comes in handy if you've been afking for a while or you want to reach a person you traded with some time ago or in case your client crashed (in-game chat gets cleared).


&nbsp; *SuperTrade mode*

Forces notification panels to NOT stack like cards. This is useful when you need to manage a lot of trades with multiple people at once, i.e. exchanging currency or other commodities. It will clutter the screen with notifications, but all of them will be right in front of your eyes. 

&nbsp; *Accessibility status*

MercuryTrade's notifications have an indication for when a person comes in or leaves your hideout - that way you can trade with him as soon as possible. Without closing your stash and without right-clicking his party frame.

An important mention: in Path of Exile when you have your stash opened you can't click on a party frame, because it's blocked by the stash window. MercuryTrader solves this inconvenience since you can interact with the person via a related notification panel.

## HOW TO INSTALL:
---

You have to download Java on your computer in order for it to work - download Java first, then open the .jar file. Because it operates on top of Path of Exile as an overlay, your client shouldn't be in fullscreen mode.

Since MercuryTrader interacts with a chat log file, you have to select your Path of Exile installation folder. Upon launch you'll be greeted with this window to do so:

Afterwards you should see 2 new overlay panels.

<br/>

[Panel 1] **Task panel**:

* (1) **Do Not Disturb** mode button switch. Upon activation prevents notifications from popping up. You can reach them through History. When DND is disabled you will be receiving notifications as usual.

* (2) **SuperTrade** mode button switch. Activated / Deactivated SuperTrade Mode - forces each notification to NOT stack like cards underneath each other.

* (3) **History** . Brings up the History panel.

* (4) **Settings**.

  * (a) Response customizations: select or create a button -> label it -> write in your message.

  * (b) Sound alert settings: always play a notification sound, only when tabbed-out or never.

  * (c) Debug Mode: send template messages to test out stuff.
  
  * (d) Notification fade time: notifications close themselves after X seconds. "0" to never fade and stay until manually dismissed.
  
* (5) **Exit**

<br/>

[Panel 2] **Notification template**

* This is a template notification for when you 1st time run the program. This allows you to reposition the panel to your taste and to just see how it looks like before you receieve a legit trade related message.

<br/>

That's it for now.
