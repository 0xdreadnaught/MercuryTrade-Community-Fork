This will most likely fix the problem.\nb) If that doesn't help either, we made another launcher as an alternative way to run the application - please check out our github page.\n\n- Item Name section in the notification panel is now a button. Click to copy item name to clipboard.\n- Better Item Grid clarity.\n- Fixed an issue with \"Restart\" panel appearing beyond the screen.",
